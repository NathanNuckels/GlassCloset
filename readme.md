# Glass Closet

### What is a glass closet?
To understand the name you need to know quite a bit of gay slang. No really, like, a lot of it.

| Glass closet             | When someone is still closeted, but everyone already knows what they are hideing.                         | I wrote a poem about this one in school. https://github.com/NathanNuckels/TheyKilledNotepad/blob/main/Writing/poatry.txt#L203 |

### There's a file missing!

Yeah. There is. 

To replace nsfw.py with a working version you need to go to my FurAffinity, clikc journals, find "nsfw look up table" and copy everything.
Then, open nsfw.py in notepad and delete everything, then paste the text you copied earlier.

If you have my FurAffinity username then I clearly trust you with what I'm hideing.
